## Reflection

I learned to traverse array of object, which helped me to create one component and reuse it multiple times. I overcame key props error while traversing throughout array of object.

The technologies implemented in this project are React and TailwindCSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
